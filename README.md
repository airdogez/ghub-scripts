scripts for Logitech mouse

# Media Controls
Based on the script by [Danamir](https://github.com/Danamir/logitech-scripts). Allows to bind macros to a second layer of mouse buttons and mouse movement gestures by using the snipe button on a logitech G502 mouse 

To function correctly, bind G-Shift to snipe button and clear all buttons on the G-Shift layer ( but keep a button with left mouse so you can still edit it!) and create the macros you need for each action.
